<p>My Name is Jaren Quintana, and this is my portfolio.
    As a son to hardworking parents and an older brother that my younger brothers look up to, 
    I've learned many things about working efficiently and as a team member. 
    I spend a lot of my time around my family, and I've gained skills from mediating disputes and managing time and money for the family.
    I also spend a lot of my time doing my hobbies. Some of them include playing musical instruments, taking pictures, and playing videogames.
