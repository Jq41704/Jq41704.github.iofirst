            <p>My Name is Jaren Quintana, and this is my portfolio.
                As a son to hardworking parents and an older brother that my younger brothers look up to,
                I've learned many things about working efficiently and as a team member.
                I spend a lot of my time around my family, and I've gained skills from mediating disputes and managing
                time and money for the family.
                I also spend a lot of my time doing my hobbies. Some of them include playing musical instruments, taking
                pictures, and playing videogames.
